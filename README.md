# SwarmRobotics

- This repository contains my Webots code for simulating bio-inspired flocking-based aggregation behaviour in swarm robotics.
- Simulations have been done using Webots R2021a. 
   Webots provides a free and open-source professional simulation environment for both virtual and real mobile robots. This software supports different programming 
   languages for robot controllers, where the behaviour of the robots is defined. For this project, all the robot controllers are written in the C and C++ 
   programming languages.

- For e-puck robots to start the aggregation behaviour, press the 'A' key.

- All e-puck robots use the “my_obstacle_avoidance” controller.
- The ‘Robot’ node uses the “my_swarming_cpp” controller.
